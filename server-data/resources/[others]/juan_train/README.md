Train script for redmrp. it starts at Valentine and goes around down to saint denis and loops around the whole map. it DOES NOT return to Valentine.

the train checks if its within a distance set. if it is, it will stop for the set amount time in client. it will then start again. Train will not start if its still within that distance! 

you can change times in the client file. default is 30 sec and 60 second.

you can change speed in the client file. find local cruisespeed/fullspeed = (your speed)
